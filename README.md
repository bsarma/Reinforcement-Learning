Reinforcement-Learning
======================

Implementation of the concept of Q-learning


1. Input: The file R.txt should be in the same directory as the code. The first line of the input file is the grid size, the second line is the discount factor and the third line is the learning rate. The learning rate and discount rate can be modified in this file itself. Walls are represented by a value of -0.2.
2. Changing the discount factor and learning rate brings a change in the magnitude of the updated values but does not make much of a difference in the number of values that get updated.
